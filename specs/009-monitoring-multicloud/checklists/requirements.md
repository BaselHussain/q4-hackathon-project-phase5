# Specification Quality Checklist: Monitoring, Logging, and Multi-Cloud Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All validation items complete

**Summary**:
- 6 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P6)
- 35 functional requirements covering all user stories
- 10 measurable success criteria (all technology-agnostic)
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries (in scope vs out of scope)
- Dependencies and assumptions documented
- Constraints and non-functional requirements defined
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All requirements are testable and unambiguous

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- No clarifications needed from user
- All requirements are well-defined based on user input
- Ready to proceed with `/sp.plan`
